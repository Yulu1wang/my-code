# Examination System
>  Hi! I am yulu wang. I'am interetsted in learning new things! and currently learning python.
>  My goal is to design a examination system using python language. It can provide a platform for teachers to roll out exams with standardized answers, while students can complete tests or quizzes on this platform and get instant feedback on the grading results. By simply collecting written information from students and comparing it with their answer sheets, the platform can automatically determine students' academic performance and give them a "fail" or "pass" result.

## General Information
- The overall project is based on Python coding, through a process of data collection, data analysis and results obtaining. 
- This examination system was created with the hope of solving 3 problems. The first is to free teachers from the busy work of grading papers; the second is to accommodate some students who are unable to take classroom exams overseas, and the third is to ensure the fairness of the exams by randomizing the questions.



## Technologies Used
- Tech 1 - random,loop structure,judgement statement，arrays，lists,  
- Tech 2 - tkinter. Most technique i used is from tkinter including to create canvases, located buttons, and input function. 



## Features
List the ready features here:
- Interface menu of the examination system; there are three buttons in main interface, there are “Information collect button””start”and “results”.The Collect Information button represents the student who needs to fill in their name and student number. Clicking on the start button means that the test is about to start and the result means that the student can view their score to determine if they passed the test.

- Test question entry.
- Answer.
- Automatic test paper judging.
- Exit the program.





## Setup
This project does not require too much software to be installed, as the project is mainly composed of code. So users can simply download a python and open 
the file to try it out.


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ . The basic code structure is complete and operational, but it is not perfect and needs further testing.


## Room for Improvement


Room for improvement:
- I still lack the actual data to test the validity of my code and identify potential errors in it.
- Not fully beautified to the desired degree, need to further learn how to use the GUI.
- The current program is only for single choice questions, and the test questions lack variety, such as multiple choice, quiz questions, etc.

To do:
- Change function: If students enter the wrong student ID number or answer they will not be able to return.
- If the student does not exit the program, the grades will be stacked indefinitely.


## Acknowledgements
Give credit here.
- This project was inspired by Covid-19 and the popularity of computers and the Internet.

- I would like to thank Dr. Bailo for a wonderful, knowledgeable, and meaningful semester. This semester has created a strong interest in learning code and made me realize that code has become an indispensable part of this era. And some of my friends, I asked some questions about GUI design like them, and they were very patient to tell me some knowledge about it and let me have more understanding.
